A recent video [insert link] and a publication of Deloitte caught my attention.
The messages of both the video and the article are more or less similar, and boils down to:
In the upcomming two to three decades a significant amount of jobs will be lossed due to automation.
The main cause, pointed out, is the automation not so much of mechanical tasks, but of decision making.
Both sources forsee, that unlike automation of mechanical tasks, automation of edcision making impacts all layers of the workforce.
In this article I will summarize the arguments made for the foreseen loss of jobs.
Next, I will discuss the: technology brings new jobs argument.
Finally, I'll reflect a bit on technology in general and link these thoughts to the title of this post: holding on to the neutrality of technology is a falacy.

# Technology brings new jobs

Or does it?
A key term in both [video] and [Delloite] is automation.
Let us have a closer look at the meaning of that word [dictionary]:


> automation: the technique, method, or system of operating or controlling a process by highly automatic means, as by electronic devices, reducing human intervention to a minimum. 

So, by its very definition, automation is about putting humans out of the loop.
Now, some people will say that technology creates new kinds of jobs.
How well, does this argument hold when we think about it for a bit?
Not much I'm afraid.
Suppose a certain technology (or combination of technologies) is reponsible for a loss of 10% of jobs.
Now, when these technologies, would also result in the same amount of new jobs, can we than really speak of automation?
In other words, when (automating) technologies create the same amount of new jobs as they replace, we should conclude that the technology in itself has failed.
And, I would argue that this is not what we typically see for new technology that truly change or impact society.
